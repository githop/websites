	  <h4> Story Time </h4> 
	  <p>While working as IT/Tech support at a small recruting company, Tom was fed up with his life. He knew that he loved
	     technology; but was overwhelmed with all the possible paths one can take within the field of technology."Do I want
	     to be a SysAdmin, an engineer, a web designer?", were all questions Tom found himself asking. Tom fell back to what he 
	     knows best: using the internet. 
	  </p> 
	  <p>The internet is a blessing and a curse. The internet both enables one to better themselves, and shames them in the 
	     process of doing so. When Tom decided to begin learning a new skill set, he knew that it had to be web related. 
	     With those guidelines, Tom set out on a knowledge journey.  
	  </p>
	  <p> While my path for knowledge started on the internet, it only seems right that it ends on the internet as well. This 
	      simple, unimpressive, rather templated website is my trophy. While I could have decided to buy storage from GoDaddy
	      and use wordpress for a CMS, I decided to play the game on hard mode, and learn how to do it myself. And while I do
	      not have much to show for, the skills I've learned to get to this point are transformative. 
	  </p>
	  <p> So lets recap: When you type in www.githop.info; your browser makes a GET request and my server responds and serves 
	      my website. Had I spent my time on content creation and used a prebuilt CMS (like wordpress), I'd probably have
	      a larger web footprint than I do now, but I wouldn't have learned anything that got me to this point. I wouldn't be
	      writing this article on my Chromebook in VIM while using a linux chroot, I wouldn't know how to use SSH to login to
	      my server or use SCP to send the files from my local machine, and I'd probably freak out if all my files weren't safe 
	      on github!
